<h5>File Format Notes</h5>
<ol>
    <li>NMEA0183</li>
    <ol>
        <li>
		Sentences may be prefixed with an accurate time but need not be prefixed.
		Both forms of sentences are processed as well:
        <pre>2013-06-29 13:58:31.120664: $GPGSV,2,1,08,15,22,186,30,04,20,091,28,25,35,267,32,17,16,040,31*7A<br>
$GPGSV,2,1,08,15,22,186,30,04,20,091,28,25,35,267,32,17,16,040,31*7A</pre>
		The accurate time is not being analyzed, yet.
        </li>
        <li>
        The sentence (i.e. GLL/RMC or DPT/DBT) with the highest update rate and most measurements is chosen to be displayed.
        </li>
    </ol><br>
    <li>NMEA2000<br>
	    The binaray Actisense *.dat format can be read. The Rapid Position Update PGN is not being used right know as it does not have the measurement time.
    </li><br>
    <li>Raymarine&#174; FSH<br>
		The contents of these recordings miss substantial information such as the measurment time and a regular depth measurment.
		If you have any other option to record data like NMEA0183, use it instead of this format.
    </li><br>
    <li>Humminbird&#174; SON<br>
		The submitted files must be zipped for a single recording.
		The zip file must contain at least a .dat file and a folder of the first sensor that contains an .idx and a .son file.
		The data contained may have been recorded from several depth sensors like a depth sensor or a side scan image but only the depths from the regular depth measurment can be accounted for.
		Side scan imagery only conveys an idea of the sea profile but no accurate depth measurements.
    </li>

<h5>Packing Notes</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Provide data files only ONCE in a format that is supported. Providing data files in multiple formats will degrade the overall quality.</li>
    <li>If you miss a format supply a git ticket with an example file, so we may add the processing facilities.</li>
    <li>You may pack a single file into a zip or multiple files into a zip with the exception of Humminbird&#174; SON files.</li>
    <li>Although we try to handle zip files with different format contents, we do not actively support it. Create zip files for every format you have.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Processing Notes</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The Kalman Filter is currently disabled. It is planned to supply a second layer where Kalman filtered data will be displayed.</li>
</ul>
